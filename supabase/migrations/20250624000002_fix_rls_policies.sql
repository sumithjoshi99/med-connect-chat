-- Fix infinite recursion in RLS policies for staff_accounts
-- Since we're using custom authentication, we need to adjust these policies

-- Drop the problematic policies that cause infinite recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all staff" ON staff_accounts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage staff" ON staff_accounts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Staff can view own account" ON staff_accounts;

-- For now, disable RLS on staff_accounts to allow our custom auth to work
-- In production, you'd want more sophisticated policies
ALTER TABLE staff_accounts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Keep RLS disabled for pharmacies, sessions, and audit_log for simpler development
ALTER TABLE pharmacies DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE staff_sessions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE audit_log DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Optional: If you want basic RLS later, you can use policies that don't reference staff_accounts
-- Example non-recursive policies:
-- CREATE POLICY "Allow all reads" ON staff_accounts FOR SELECT USING (true);
-- CREATE POLICY "Allow all writes" ON staff_accounts FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Comment explaining the change
COMMENT ON TABLE staff_accounts IS 'RLS temporarily disabled to avoid infinite recursion. Custom auth system handles access control.';
